###### About the Wisconsin Coastal Guide

The Wisconsin Coastal Guide is a joint project of the University of [Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute](http://www.seagrant.wisc.edu/) and the [Land Information and Computer Graphics Facility](http://www.lic.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Development of the project was funded by the [Wisconsin Coastal Management Program](http://coastal.wisconsin.gov/) with support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, [Office for Coastal Management](https://coast.noaa.gov/) through the Coastal Zone Management Act.  

The goal of the project is to encourage travelers along the Great Lakes Circle Tour to explore the many coastal access sites and natural and cultural attractions to be found on the rural roads and downtown streets that hug Wisconsin’s Lake Michigan and Lake Superior coasts.  

The site uses the [Google Maps Application Programming Interfaces](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to view the Lake Superior and Lake Michigan Circle Tour routes with relation to coastal features such as parks, beaches, lighthouses, and shipwrecks. Clicking on the map features links to external web content about individual Great Lakes attractions. Panorama photos were taken at hundreds of public access sites and scenic vistas on Wisconsin’s Great Lakes shores. These photos are presented with a user-controllable field of view that is synchronized with a local map to indicate the direction in which the user is looking.
