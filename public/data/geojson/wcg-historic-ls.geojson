{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Superior, Wisconsin", "description": "Strategically located at the western end of Lake Superior, the Duluth-Superior area (Fond du Lac as the French called it) for centuries has played a key role in the development of North America.  The waterways with their connecting rivers, and in more recent times rail and pipeline networks stretching from the lake far inland, made it a major transition point for moving people and all kinds of goods across the larger part of the continent.  Natural bounty from the rich resources of wildlife, fish, forests, and mines in the immediate area and the bountiful wheat belt funneled through Duluth-Superior.  The port cities also grew partly by processing and manufacturing these natural riches.  \n<br><br>\nThe harbor, called \"one of the finest natural harbors in the world,\" has contributed greatly to the growth of the two cities for more than 125 years.  A long sand spit acting as a breakwater created it.  This strip of sand stretched for 10 miles with one natural entry, known as Superior Entry, where the St. Louis River flowed through a half-mile opening and emptied into Lake Superior.  Today one section is called Minnesota Point and the other Wisconsin Point.  The sand spit created a shallow bay suitable for port development, different parts of which are now called Superior Bay and Allouez Bay.  The St. Louis River widens into St. Louis Bay as it empties into the larger bay areas, creating a large area well suited to harbor and industrial development.\n<br><br>\nFor thousands of years Native People found the sand spit a choice place for fishing.  The shallow swampy upper part of the bay nurtured cranberries and many other kinds of food.  The nearby woodlands and bluffs offered protection from lake turbulence.  Firewood was abundant.  In the seventeenth century both the Ojibwa and Sioux competed to dominate the area's natural riches and strategic value for trade and travel.  \n<br><br>\nThe early recorded history of Duluth-Superior related the experiences of French explorers, fur traders, and missionaries and their contacts with Native People in the Fond du Lac area.  Etienne Brule may have been the first Frenchman in 1623.  Jesuit Father Claude Jean Allouez visited the Sioux here in 1667.  Pierre Esprit Radisson and Medard Chouart Des Groseilliers in their pursuit of fortunes in the fur trade probably were here earlier in the decade.  Daniel Greysolon Dulhut in 1679 met with the Sioux somewhere within present-day Duluth in an effort to establish peaceful relations with them and to discourage warfare with the Ojibwe, which so disrupted the fur trade.  In the era of the French, British, and American fur trade, the Duluth-Superior location made an ideal rendezvous point where furs from the interior came by river and trade goods carried from the east could be exchanged.\n<br><br>\nWith the decline in the fur trade, the Duluth-Superior location drew little interest for westward moving settlers and entrepreneurial investors until the building of the canal at Sault Ste. Marie and the boom times of the 1850s.  Then the western end of Lake Superior attracted eastern capital and enthusiastic developers.  Like those who dreamed of founding great Lake Superior ports at Ashland and Bayfield, other groups cast their eyes on Fond du Lac.  Both Superior and Duluth trace city beginnings to the mid-1850s.  Both declined into virtual ghost towns in the ensuing panic of 1857 and during the Civil War years.  Both revived briefly in the early 1870s and then took on new life with the construction of railroads connecting them to more densely populated areas and to the developing areas of the trans-Mississippi West.  Railroads and port improvements were the keys to their growth.\n<br><br>\nDuluth got a rail connection in the early 1870s in large part from the efforts of prominent financier Jay Cooke, who in the late 1860s turned his enthusiasm and influence into developing Duluth as a port city and terminus for the Northern Pacific Railroad projected to be built to Portland, Oregon.  He was the leading figure in securing completion of a rail line from St. Paul to Duluth in 1871.  Two million bushels of grain were shipped during the first year of operations.  He promoted the building of grain storage elevators, railroad docks, wharves, houses, stores, schools, churches, and a bank.  Yet with the financial panic of 1873, Cooke's grandiose plans came to an abrupt halt.  The railroad connection was one major lasting contribution of the early 1870s, as was a major harbor improvement.\n<br><br>\nSuperior, with a sudden burst of development in the boom years 1855-57, had outstripped Duluth before lapsing into the doldrums.  With returning prosperity in the 1870s, Superior revived largely due to the leadership of General John H. Hammond of St. Paul, an entrepreneur with railroad interests and excellent eastern connections from which capital poured into the port city.  Superior received its first railroad with the arrival of the Northern Pacific in 1881 after a hard battle to achieve the connection.  Coal docks, lumber mills, merchandise docks, and the beginnings of a number of businesses housed in impressive brick and brownstone structures completely changed an earlier modest appearance.  Commercial boom times followed in the 1880s and continued until the nationwide depression of 1893.  In 1890 Superior's population numbered almost 12,000, and in 1910 it was the second largest city in Wisconsin with 40,384 residents.  In 1889 Superior received city status, and Duluth did so for the second time in 1887, having lapsed into a village in the depressed 1870s.  In 1890 Duluth's population numbered over 33,100.  Clearly both Duluth and Superior had achieved national prominence as the major ports on Lake Superior, hubs of trade and commerce in the midcontinent.  \n<br><br>\nAn intense rivalry between the two cities marked their efforts to grow, each trying to dominate the trade and commerce at the west end of the lake.  The rivalry focused in large measure on harbor improvements as well as railroad connections, both essential ingredients for success.  The unimproved natural harbor when surveyed in 1861 was shallow, 5 to 8 feet deep, with the exception of the St. Louis River channel, which was 15 to 20 feet deep as it flowed through Superior Bay to the lake outlet.  Superior advocated dredging and improving the opening into the lake.  Duluth tried first to develop a harbor in the lake beyond Minnesota Point by constructing a breakwater.  In 1856 the Superior Entry acquired a lighthouse on Minnesota Point and a federal appropriation for dredging work to improve its dangerously shallow waters along with pier construction, which began in 1868 and was a seven-year project.  Meanwhile, Duluth developers found the facilities on the lake unsatisfactory and pushed for construction of a canal to cut through Minnesota Point and open directly into the lake.  \n<br><br>\nMany in Superior feared the consequences of the canal across the point because it would give easy harbor access to Duluth and might also divert the waters of the St. Louis River away from the Superior Entry, which Superior counted on for access.  Despite Superior's objections, canal construction went forward.  In the fall of 1870 the city of Duluth, with the blessing and support of Jay Cooke, started digging.  One of the most dramatic incidents in the saga of canal improvements on Lake Superior followed.  Winter weather stalled the work, and after it resumed in 1871 the people of Superior decided to stop the project.  They secured a federal court injunction to halt construction and enlisted the aid of the U.S. War Department to deliver it.  Duluth authorities learned of the injunction three days in advance of its delivery by an army officer traveling from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  Feverish dredging and digging ensued.  Legend has it that the townspeople turned out en masse to help finish the digging job.  By the time the injunction was served, the canal was an accomplished fact.\n<br><br>\nTo quiet ill feeling in Superior, the city of Duluth issued a $100,000 performance bond to build a dike to prevent the canal from diverting the current of the St. Louis River.  Upon completion of the dike, the people of Superior complained that it denied them access to the only railroad connection, the line completed in 1871 between St. Paul and Duluth.  After much litigation and wrangling, the dike disappeared, and the canal turned out to enhance the current through the Superior Entry rather than spoil it.  The completion of the railroad and the canal in 1871gave Duluth unquestionable port advantage.  \n<br><br>\nDuluth and Superior experienced their first spectacular boom with the timber harvest in the adjacent areas and grew in the 1880s and 1890s into the most important lumber products and shippers in the Midwest, serving eastern and western markets, particularly the new areas developing to the west as railroad construction and settlement made their way toward the Pacific.  The peak of lumbering trade came in 1899, when 940,000 tons of lumber and lumber products left the twin ports.  Duluth-Superior achieved the status of the world's largest lumbering market for a short time early in the twentieth century.\n<br><br>\nWhile the lumber trade escalated, the twin ports in the 1880s expanded enormously as grain shipments from developing western wheat lands arrived by rail.  Grain elevators and flour mills dotted the harbor.  The peak in flour shipments came in 1894, when one million tons were shipped.  Grain, on the other hand, continued as a major component of harbor commerce.  In 1898, some 2.1 million tons were shipped, and at the end of World War II the shipment of 4.1 million tons set a record.  Once the St. Lawrence Seaway opened, the total grain exports rose to 75 million tons during the next 15 years.\n<br><br>\nWith the opening of the Mesabi Iron Range, iron ore shipments added an enormous tonnage to shipments from Duluth-Superior.  The first outbound ore shipment in 1892 of 4,000 gross tons was a very modest beginning.  The totals climbed to 6.5 million tons in 1901, 50 million tons in 1929, and 90 million tons in 1942.  In 2000 the twin ports shipped 14.5 million tons.  Iron ore was and is the major bulk cargo handled at the port.\n<br><br>\nCommerce in coal added to the huge tonnages passing through the harbor, with coal from the east carried in freighters on their return trip from transporting wheat to eastern markets.  The westbound coal trade began in the early 1880s and continued through the age of steam power and steam heat and then declined in the 1950s, when the use of other fossil fuels began to replace it.  Between 1912 and 1930 inbound coal traffic averaged 10 million tons annually, an all-time eighteen-year high in the ports' history.  Much of this coal went westward by rail.  In recent time the coal traffic has originated from the West, with the coal loaded aboard freighters at Duluth-Superior and shipped east and south to supply power-generating plants.  Petroleum products and general merchandise added further substantial tonnage to port totals.  From 1913 to 1953 Duluth-Superior ranked second only to the port of New York in tonnage handled.\n<br><br>\nThe long-cherished dream of a connection to the Atlantic Ocean materialized in 1959 after years of frustrating effort, and Duluth-Superior entered a new era in overseas trade as an international seaport in midcontinent.  The recently created Seaport Authority of Duluth was ready for the event with a completed terminal on Superior Bay from which 1.99 million tons of grain and grain products destined for overseas passed through the harbor the first season, followed by 2.43 million tons the next year.\n<br><br>\nThe ever-changing patterns of port traffic during the past 150 years are complex, shaped by national and international influences, but two components of Duluth-Superior's success remain constant:  Lake Superior and a great harbor.  These have shaped the course of the cities' economic, social, and cultural development.\n<br><br>\nThe lake provided a great avenue of transportation and a challenge to all who would ply its waters safely.  It called forth major federal funding for navigational improvements and safe passage, among them large appropriations for dredging the Duluth-Superior harbor and maintaining the canal passage through Minnesota Point and the natural opening between Minnesota and Wisconsin Points.  It nurtured generations of boat builders, to which Duluth-Superior added its share.  Most well known among them was Alexander McDougall, an experienced Great Lakes ship captain and boat builder who developed and built forty-six uniquely designed steel whaleback ore carriers at Superior between 1888 and 1898 in response to the need to transport the ores of the Mesabi Range.\n<br><br>\nThis famous experiment in steel carrier construction often overshadows a larger picture of shipbuilding at Duluth-Superior.  The American Shipbuilding Company built thirty ore carriers in the years 1899-1936.  Superior and Duluth achieved new heights in shipbuilding during World Wars I and II.  Alexander McDougall established the McDougall-Duluth Company in 1916 and built thirty-six steel vessels during the next five years.  Vessel construction at Duluth-Superior totaled 105 in that period.  Shipbuilding at the twin ports reached its greatest level of production in World War II when seven shipyards built 191 vessels.  The Walter Butler Shipyards at Superior working under government contract produced fifty-two vessels, small coastal and ocean-going freighters and U.S. Navy corvettes.  One other obviously lake-related industry, commercial fishing, was for a time vigorously pursued from Duluth-Superior.  Tried experimentally in the 1830s by the American Fur Company at its Fond du Lac post, commercial fishing and packing at Duluth reached its greatest development in the late nineteenth century through World War I.\n<br><br>\nThis brief treatment of Lake Superior and the rise of Duluth-Superior as a leading port on the Great Lakes is offered to give visitors some understanding of how these beautifully sited cities came to be.  The information is based largely on David A. Walker and Stephen P. Hall, <i>Duluth-Superior Harbor Cultural Resources Study<\/i> (St. Paul, August 1976), prepared for the Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District; Paul R. Lusignan, <i>Superior Intensive Survey Report<\/i> (Madison:  Historic Preservation Division of State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1983), prepared for Superior Department of Community Development; and Glenn N. Sandvik, <i>Duluth:  An Illustrated History of the Zenith City<\/i>.\n<br><br>\nIn 2004, Duluth, with a population of 87,000, down from a high of 107,000 in 1960, and Superior, with a population of 27,400, down from its height of 40,400 in 1910, have long since passed the era of scoffing and name-calling rivalry.  Both grew as transportation hubs and from commerce, trade, and manufacturing, but neither realized the dreams of turning into major centers rivaling Chicago.  Both had their lumber industries and flour-milling establishments, and Duluth had its U.S. Steel plant, a mainstay in its economy from 1915 to the early 1970s.  Currently trade, retail, and wholesale commerce, transportation and a wide variety of services (educational, medical, financial, governmental), and the tourism and recreation-related industry employ by far the larger part of the workforce.  Tourism and recreation with the lakefront as a major focus have risen to great importance in community planning goals since the 1960s.  Development of Canal and Bayfront Parks in Duluth and Harbor Front Park and Barker's Island in Superior, designed to appeal to tourists and visitors as well as residents, have succeeded in attracting tens of thousands annually.  \n<br><br>\nAs travelers cross over St. Louis Bay from Superior to Duluth on the U.S. Highway 53 bridge, the beauty of the port and the bluffs of Duluth come into clear view.  Especially on a clear day they make a stunning sight, reflecting a remarkable human achievement in harnessing the natural resources of lake, river, and land.  By the other side of the coin, spectacular growth and development have come at an enormous environmental cost.  The great harbor carries a burden of toxic sediments shown from current investigation to have accumulated over the decades.  Repeated dredging to change the depth from its original 5-8 feet to meet the needs of ever-larger ships wrought massive change, and the practice of repeatedly dumping dredge spoil into Lake Superior shifted toxic wastes from harbor to lake.  The long-accepted practices of emptying all manner of waste materials including human and industrial sewage into the St. Louis River, its tributary streams, and Superior and Allouez Bays took an increasingly heavy toll on water quality over time, growing as human activity grew.  Currently government at all levels and nongovernment environmental groups are at work to mitigate and rectify the damage.  Cleanup is a long-term, expensive, and difficult task, with improved water quality as a major goal as well as fish suitable for human consumption--free from tumors and with low mercury and PCB contamination.\n<br><br>\nBogue, <i>Around the Shores of Lake Superior<\/i>, 101-109.<br>\nCopyright &copy; 2007<br>\nThe Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System<br>\nAll rights reserved.", "timestamp": null, "begin": null, "end": null, "altitudeMode": null, "tessellate": -1, "extrude": 0, "visibility": -1, "drawOrder": null, "icon": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -92.10381656104839, 46.720743477707657, 0.0 ] } },

The bubble burst in 1887, but by then Hurley had three mines,\nand in neighboring Gile (now part of Montreal) ﬁfteen mines had opened. Hurley connected\nvia the newly built railroad to Ashland and developed as a supply and outﬁtting center. Logging,\na second large resource-based industry, accompanied mining. In 1886 an estimated 2,000 wood\nchoppers were at work on the iron range, supplying partly essential timber for the mines and a\nlarger market as well. Hurley’s next-door neighbor, Gile, developed as a sawmill village. Hurley mushroomed \nmiraculously from the few frame buildings, log cabins, and tents of 1885 on Silver\nStreet into ﬁve blocks of storefronts two years later, most of them consumed by ﬁre that summer\nand soon rebuilt.\n<br><br>\nIronwood and Hurley grew side by side with Ironwood’s Aurora Street connecting directly\nwith Hurley’s Silver Street via the Montreal River bridge. They were rival communities, both\nfocused on iron mining, but with very different popular images. Ironwood emerged as the more\nsedate center of numerous fabulously productive mines and commerce, whereas Hurley was the\nsin city, “the hell hole of the range,” notorious for gambling and for saloons and brothels on\nSilver Street catering allegedly to rowdy men from the lumber camps and mines. That image belies\nthe reality of the hardworking, sober majority, many of them immigrants from the British Isles,\nScandinavia, Italy, and eastern Europe as well as American-born workers, and it discounts the\nefforts of hardworking pastors of the many denominations who tried to encourage peace and\ncivility. The Italian-speaking population grew large enough in 1904 to support an Italian language\nnewspaper, <i>La Nostra Terra<\/i>.\n<br><br>\nHurley was Edna Ferber’s Iron Ridge in <i>Come and Get It<\/i>, a scathing critique of Wisconsin’s\nlumber and papermaking industry. Hurley became the county seat in 1893 when, after repeated\nattempts to create Iron County, advocates of county status ﬁnally achieved success. Like the other\ntowns of the Gogebic-Penokee Range, Hurley suffered population decline and loss of business\nwhen mines shut down. The last of them, the Montreal and the Cary, shut down in 1962 and 1964, respectively. \nMoreover the once luxuriously forested lands that sustained the lumber industry\ndegenerated into cutover lands where ﬁres swept through the slash, destroying seedlings and\nthe soil’s organic matter early in the twentieth century, and where farmers struggled to make farms\nin rocky, stump-ﬁlled lands.\n<br><br>\nCurrently with a population of approximately 1,800, the community’s economy is built on a\nvariety of services. Year-round tourism and recreation, especially skiing and snowmobiling, are very\nimportant. Marking the great change, the Hurley Chamber of Commerce declared in January\n1969, “the area economy is based on ‘white gold, not iron ore.’”\n<br><br>\nBogue, <i>Around the Shores of Lake Superior<\/i>, 315-317.<br>\nCopyright &copy; 2007<br>\nThe Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System<br>\nAll rights reserved.", "timestamp": null, "begin": null, "end": null, "altitudeMode": null, "tessellate": -1, "extrude": 0, "visibility": -1, "drawOrder": null, "icon": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -90.181791934679623, 46.450872202932388, 0.0 ] } },

This brings the stream on a level with Lake Superior, which it\njoins in a broad deep stream, with reddish coloured water. This view is highly picturesque.” He noted that fur traders destined for Lac du Flambeau used the river, which beginning at its mouth required “a portage of one hundred and twenty pauses.” The power company has provided a\nparking lot and a viewing trail for the many visitors who come to enjoy the falls.\n<br><br>\nBogue, <i>Around the Shores of Lake Superior<\/i>, 319-320.<br>\nCopyright &copy; 2007<br>\nThe Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System<br>\nAll rights reserved.", "timestamp": null, "begin": null, "end": null, "altitudeMode": null, "tessellate": -1, "extrude": 0, "visibility": -1, "drawOrder": null, "icon": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -90.415763499678434, 46.563430475154007, 0.0 ] } },

Nearby are a cultural center and a number of newly built houses. If\nvisitors arrive at powwow time in mid- to late August, they can join the crowd for a colorful,\ntraditional experience. Current impressions of reservation life tell but one small part of the band’s\nhistory over the past 150 years, a prolonged struggle with poverty, disease, inadequate health\ncare, substandard housing, education in government-sponsored boarding schools, and loss of\ntribal lands, all the products of a federal policy for many decades designed to suppress Native\nculture and to assimilate the Ojibwe into the dominant culture.\n<br><br>\nThe Bad River Reservation created by the Treaty of La Pointe in 1854 originally included\n124,000 acres of heavily forested land and wetlands including the Bad River, Sand Cut, and Kakagon\nSloughs, the latter a source of abundant wild rice. It contains 17 miles of Lake Superior\nshoreline and 200 acres on Madeline Island. It is named for the Bad River, located in the lower\nreaches of that watershed, apparently named “Bad” due to mistranslations from the original\nOjibwe to French to English.\n<br><br>\nThe 1887 federal allotment policy of assigning 80-acre parcels to individual tribal members\ndesigned to foster assimilation into American society led to a great loss of land for the Ojibwe.\nIn the case of the Bad River Reservation the band lost most of the land due in large measure\nto greedy lumbermen and ineffective federal agents administering ill-conceived national policies\nin the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Then the damage was done, and now much\nof the original reservation is in private ownership where logging continues.\n<br><br>\nCurrently the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa has over 6,000 members, 1,500\nliving on the reservation and the balance elsewhere. They are governed by an elected six-person\ntribal council and a chairman.\n<br><br>\nThe reservation is recognized as a valuable ecological region. Its rivers and wetlands provide\nspawning grounds for lake trout, salmon, and walleye and a sheltered habitat for a great variety\nof wildlife. The Environmental Protection Agency recognizes the sloughs as containing “the only\nremaining extensive coastal wild rice marsh in the Great Lakes Basin.” And the agency recognizes\nthe Bad River Band’s commitment to environmental protection through the work of the band’s\nNatural Resources Department, which employs nineteen specialists. For the second time in a decade \nthe Bad River Ojibwe made environmental headlines in September 2003 when, with the assistance \nof the Nature Conservancy, they purchased 21,322 acres and 24 miles of river and streams critically \nimportant in preserving the Kakagon-Bad River Sloughs and Lake Superior water quality. The band paid \n$4.5 million to retrieve into tribal ownership approximately one-ﬁfth of its original area. Noted Tribal \nCouncil chairman Eugene Bigboy: “The heart and soul of any reservation, aside from its people, is its \nland. This purchase enables the Band to get back precious land that was once thought lost forever.”\nThe band’s commitment to protecting its natural resources and to developing a Bad River watershed \nmanagement plan for general adoption bodes well for the future.\n<br><br>\nBogue, <i>Around the Shores of Lake Superior<\/i>, 320-322.<br>\nCopyright &copy; 2007<br>\nThe Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System<br>\nAll rights reserved.", "timestamp": null, "begin": null, "end": null, "altitudeMode": null, "tessellate": -1, "extrude": 0, "visibility": -1, "drawOrder": null, "icon": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -90.676217893085692, 46.530806339153649, 0.0 ] } },

This decade marked the beginnings of\nAshland, Bayﬁeld, Superior, and Duluth, spurred on by the opening of the Sault Ste. Marie Canal\nin 1855. Surely the south shore with the lake as an avenue of cheap transportation and with its\nwealth of copper, potential riches of iron ore, and vast timber supply stood on the eve of wonderful\ndevelopment. Such dreams inspired Asaph Whittlesey and George Kilborn to travel from\nLa Pointe into Chequamegon Bay looking for a town site, a future great port city with a wellprotected\nharbor. They chose the location of present-day Ashland on July 5, 1854, named in honor\nof Senator Henry Clay’s Kentucky home. The panic of 1857, the Civil War, and the depression\nof 1873 came and went before Ashland realized its potential as a Lake Superior port. The completion\nof the Wisconsin Central Railroad to Ashland in 1877 contributed greatly to the period\nof expansive growth that followed. Other railroads running east, west, and south during the next\ntwenty years further connected Ashland with the national rail network.\n<br><br>\nAshland developed ﬁrst primarily as a sawmill town. Mill output beginning in 1872 grew\nsteadily year by year well into the 1890s. In 1893 its ten mills turned the log harvest from the rich\nsurrounding forests into an estimated 300 billion board feet of lumber. While lumber also went\nto market by rail, beginning in the mid-1870s the harbor served the lumber mills that sent their products \nto Isle Royale, Duluth, and Superior. It also served the Lake Superior brownstone quarries\nalong the shore north of Ashland, where as many as eight operated in the 1880s shipping\nthousands of tons of “Ashland Stone” downlake for use in major cities such as Chicago, Buffalo,\nand New York. For decades Ashland’s harbor handled log rafts from Canada and Minnesota’s\nnorth shore guided over Lake Superior’s waters to the log hoist pier where workmen maneuvered\nthem to railroad gondola cars for delivery to pulp mills. A tug guided the last raft into Ashland\nharbor in 1972.\n<br><br>\nIn 1885, with the construction of the ﬁrst ore dock and a rail line to Hurley built to handle\nore from the newly opened iron mines, the Ashland harbor entered a long and active period of\nore shipments destined for the steel mills on the southern shores of Lakes Erie and Michigan.\nA second dock was built in the same year and a third in 1887. Ore shipments grew. In 1892, with\nthe country in the midst of great industrial expansion and heavy demand for iron and steel, 1,316\nships carrying over 2.2 million tons of ore left the docks. Ashland was then the largest ore shipper\non Lake Superior. Now only one ore dock is left, and the last shipment cleared port in 1965.\n<br><br>\nAs harbor traffic in lumber, brownstone, and iron ore grew, Ashland developed a prosperous\ncommercial district, and its population grew from 951 in 1880 to 13,000 in 1900, reaching a high\nof 14,500 in 1905. Many of its workers were new Americans from Poland, Germany, Lithuania,\nthe Scandinavian countries, and Ireland, an ethnic diversity reﬂected in the city’s many churches\nand social organizations founded along ethnic lines. The city population has declined to about\n8,700 at the present.\n<br><br>\nCurrently the Ashland economy is based on commerce and a wide range of services with a\nstrong tourism and recreation component. The rebuilding of the handsome Chequamegon Hotel\nand the development of an adjacent marina were designed to strengthen the tourist trade. Northland\nCollege, founded in 1892, a four-year college focusing on the liberal arts and the environment,\ncontributes substantially to community cultural and economic vitality.

Bayﬁeld had\nbeen designated the county seat in 1869, but citizens of the newer, larger, and booming community\nof Washburn launched a campaign in the 1892 election year to capture the county seat. Using dubiously \nlegal tactics they succeeded in getting a majority in favor of Washburn. Immediately\nafter the results were declared official, Washburn residents formed a caravan, went to Bayﬁeld,\noccupied the courthouse, gathered up the official documents, and departed for home. The ﬁrst\ncourthouse at Washburn was a small wooden building. The city completed the current beautiful\nLake Superior brownstone structure in 1894.\n<br><br>\nWashburn now has a population of almost 2,300. The days of its glory as a lumbering and\nshipping center are long gone, yet that past provides much of its current appeal. Tourism and\nrecreation utilizing the beautiful surrounding resources of lake and land are important to the\neconomy. The city has cultivated its historic past to enhance further its attractiveness for visitors\nand vacationers. The handsome brownstone buildings of the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies, one dozen of them identiﬁed in a 1975 survey, are much in evidence, and the project\nof restoring the 1890 Bank of Washburn, an impressive structure located on the main route\nthrough town, has especially drawn attention. Historical markers help visitors understand the city\nhistory.\n<br><br>\nBogue, <i>Around the Shores of Lake Superior<\/i>, 328-329.<br>\nCopyright &copy; 2007<br>\nThe Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System<br>\nAll rights reserved.", "timestamp": null, "begin": null, "end": null, "altitudeMode": null, "tessellate": -1, "extrude": 0, "visibility": -1, "drawOrder": null, "icon": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -90.900498522322906, 46.672630283397318, 0.0 ] } },

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Bayfield, WI", "description": "State Highway 13 \n<br><br>\nFilled with the optimism and dreams of boom times, in 1856 the Minnesota territorial delegate\nto Congress from St. Paul, Henry M. Rice, platted Bayﬁeld as a future large Lake Superior shipping\nand industrial port on Chequamegon Bay. He called it Bayﬁeld in honor of his friend, British Navy Admiralty \nsurveyor Henry Wolsey Bayﬁeld, who had surveyed Lake Superior in 1824-25. His work is noted for its \ngreat accuracy in producing maps used for decades as the best navigational tools available.\n<br><br>\nIn 1857 the U.S. Congress provided a land grant for construction of a railroad that would\nlink St. Paul and Bayﬁeld, but hard times and the Civil War intervened before the line could be\nbuilt. Not until 1883 did the ﬁrst train arrive. Meanwhile, Lake Superior provided the way to\nmarkets where a post-Civil War expansive national economy provided a demand for lumber and\nﬁsh. Bayﬁeld’s lumbering and ﬁshing industries grew, and by 1883 the village had a population of\nmore than 500. The brownstone quarries and tourism gave additional vitality to the community,\npromising, so it seemed to Bayﬁeld promoters, long-term prosperity. The brownstone courthouse,\nbuilt in 1883-84 and now headquarters for the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, symbolized\nthe community’s well-being and optimism.\n<br><br>\nBayﬁeld’s best, most prosperous years extended into the twentieth century, with the population\npeaking at 2,692 in 1910 and then falling by 1,000 a decade later. By then the forests that\nhad fed its sawmills were gone; commercial ﬁshing, long suffering from sawmill pollution and\noverﬁshing, was clearly in decline; and tourism, which had grown substantially after 1883, went\ninto a slump. The brownstone industry had shut down with the change in public architectural\ntaste. The interest in fruit growing, especially apples and strawberries, promoted by William\nKnight (see the William Knight House, below) remained, and farmers struggled to develop farms\non the nearby stump-ﬁlled cutover lands. Fishing continued to provide a living for some until\nthe onset of the sea lamprey invasion further eroded that source of income. Bayﬁeld went through\na period of slack times until more recent decades. Now that has changed, and a new prosperity\ngives the village new life.\n<br><br>\nBayﬁeld’s past glory and the beautiful Lake Superior waters, with the adjacent Apostle Islands,\nprovided a special place in the late twentieth century for affluent Americans seeking vacation and \nrecreation experiences in scenic places for summer homes. The creation of the Apostle Islands\nNational Lakeshore in 1970 has protected most of this major natural Lake Superior island group\nfrom residential development. Instead housing utilizes prime space along the mainland shores\nand on Madeline Island, not part of the Lakeshore. The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore\nencourages public enjoyment of the islands’ natural beauty and their natural and human heritage,\nobjectives that attract thousands to Bayﬁeld every year.\n<br><br>\nThe village, now with a permanent population of a little over 600, draws much of its vitality\nfrom the tourism and recreation industry based on water sports, especially sailing and kayaking,\nenjoyment of the natural environment, and the town’s historic past. In winter, dogsledding, skiing,\nsnowshoeing, and snowmobiling draw many. In 1980 the Bayﬁeld Historic District was added\nto the National Register of Historic Places. The nomination papers note that it was deﬁned to\ninclude most of a well-preserved Lake Superior village. Bayﬁeld’s spectacular physical setting, long\neconomic decline, and relative isolation have allowed the village to retain much of the ﬂavor of\nits robust early years.\n<br><br>\nBogue, <i>Around the Shores of Lake Superior<\/i>, 331-334.<br>\nCopyright &copy; 2007<br>\nThe Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System<br>\nAll rights reserved.", "timestamp": null, "begin": null, "end": null, "altitudeMode": null, "tessellate": -1, "extrude": 0, "visibility": -1, "drawOrder": null, "icon": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -90.820295443334473, 46.810899209874549, 0.0 ] } },

The Apostle Islands came under the supervision\nof the National Park Service after years of advocacy, debate, and compromise. Wisconsin senator \nGaylord Nelson spearheaded the effort, ably assisted by a host of fellow advocates. On December \n8, 2004, approximately 80 percent of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore was designated\nthe Gaylord Nelson Wilderness.\n<br><br>\nAmong Lake Superior’s more extensive breeding grounds for whiteﬁsh and many other species,\nthe islands attracted commercial ﬁshing enterprises and for years the bounty of Apostle Island\nwaters made Bayﬁeld a leading Lake Superior commercial ﬁshing port. The American Fur Company\ncarried on a ﬁshery in the Apostles in the 1830s, and from about 1870 to the sea lamprey\ndevastation of the 1940s, commercial ﬁshermen made their seasonal camps on the islands. The\nApostles also supported a brownstone industry on Basswood, Hermit, and Stockton Islands and\nlogging on Stockton Island and on most of the others.\n<br><br>\nOn the southeast corner of Sand Island, originally among the more developed of the islands\nincluded in the National Lakeshore, Francis Shaw, a Civil War veteran, built two log structures\nin 1871. These marked the beginning of what grew to be a small ﬁsher-farmer community where\nyear-round residents skillfully combined ﬁshing, farming, and logging for a livelihood, adding as \ntime went by hospitality and services to visitors and vacationers. In the early twentieth century\nthe community prospered with a year-round population of 75 to 100. The National Register\nnomination papers for Shaw Farm note: “Over the years, the buildings of the farm served\nthe islanders with a post office, a general store, a community ice and smoke house, and a social\ncenter.”\n<br><br>\nNot far from Shaw Farm another National Register site reﬂects both maritime tragedy and\nthe booster spirit of an editor and prominent Wisconsin state political ﬁgure. Sevona Cabin preserves\nthe memory of the wreck of the <i>Sevona<\/i>, a steel-hulled bulk carrier loaded with 6,000 tons\nof iron ore bound for Erie, Pennsylvania. In a terrible storm on September 2, 1905, it ran aground\nand broke apart on Sand Island Shoals, with the loss of at least seven lives. The hatch covers\nfrom the wreck that washed ashore on Sand Island captured the imagination of Samuel Fiﬁeld,\nwhom the National Register nomination papers identify as “author, founder of the <i>Bayﬁeld Press<\/i>,\nfounder and editor of the <i>Ashland Press<\/i>, speaker of the state legislature, state senator, and lieutenant\ngovernor of Wisconsin.” Fiﬁeld had the hatch covers gathered and used them to build\nmajor portions of Sevona Cabin. Fiﬁeld operated a small resort, Camp Stella, on Sand Island.\nHe used his writing skills to publicize the natural beauty of the Apostle Islands area and to boost\ntourism and local agriculture. Both of these National Register properties are off-limits to the\npublic and are occupied by former owners under special agreements with the Apostle Islands\nNational Lakeshore.\n<br><br>\nWhen the federal government acquired the islands, a number of remainders from past use of\ntheir natural resources were in place. In addition to the two sites on Sand Island, some of these\nhave been developed to illustrate the islands’ history, and a number have been included on the \nNational Register of Historic Places, as have the lighthouses built on Sand, Raspberry, Devil’s,\nOuter, and Michigan Islands and two on Long Island to facilitate ship traffic. The National Park\nService has broadly considered the task of cultural as well as natural preservation and use of the\nislands for the beneﬁt of the public.\n<br><br>\nMarkers, interpretive development of speciﬁc sites such as former ﬁshing camps, and rangers\nand volunteer guides at speciﬁed places and times during the summer months help visitors understand\nthe islands’ natural and cultural heritage. Notable among the interpretive locations are the\nHokenson Fishery at Little Sand Bay and the Manitou Fish Camp on Manitou Island. Ranger-led\nevents such as nature walks, lighthouse and ﬁsh camp tours, and campﬁre programs are scheduled,\nwith information about them available at visitors centers, in Bayﬁeld, on Stockton Island,\nand at Little Sand Bay.\n<br><br>\nLake Superior is a lake with hundreds of islands, all different and distinctive: Isle Royale, Grand\nIsland, the island-strewn waters of Nipigon Bay and the far north shore, and Michipicoten Island,\nto mention some of the more obvious. The Apostle Islands are noteworthy because they also\nillustrate in so many ways the relationships between Lake Superior and the people who made\ntheir homes and livelihoods around its shores, relying on the natural bounty they found there.\n<br><br>\nThe Apostles have a rich maritime history extending over many centuries. According to an\nApostle Islands National Lakeshore historian, six light stations and eight light towers with seven\nworking lights have furnished protection for passing vessels. Extensive underwater archaeological\nresearch has added substantially to that maritime history. This work has established detailed\naccounts of six ship sinkings in the years 1886-1909, which reveal the dramatic details of vessels \nand lives lost in violent fall storms and ﬁres aboard ship, lives saved by strenuous efforts to make\nshore, and an heroic rescue by an Outer Island lighthouse keeper. This archaeological work relates\nto a fraction of catastrophes in the Apostles and adjacent waters. All of these are part of the\nbroad view of the relationship of people and the Apostles for visitors to ponder when enjoying\nthe beautiful shores with their bays, beaches, trees, and rocks, and the wind- and water-carved\ncaves, most notably on Devil’s and Stockton Islands.\n<br><br>\nBogue, <i>Around the Shores of Lake Superior<\/i>, 337-341.<br>\nCopyright &copy; 2007<br>\nThe Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System<br>\nAll rights reserved.", "timestamp": null, "begin": null, "end": null, "altitudeMode": null, "tessellate": -1, "extrude": 0, "visibility": -1, "drawOrder": null, "icon": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -90.665518584803976, 46.985590319641183, 0.0 ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Madeline Island", "description": "By Ferry From Bayfield\n<br><br>\nNot included in the National Lakeshore, Madeline Island, the largest and perhaps the most well\nknown of the Apostle Islands, has a long human history stretching well back into prehistoric\ntimes. According to Ojibwe tradition supported by artifactual evidence, the Ojibwe came to the\nisland in the decade before Columbus touched shore in the Bahamas. Many archaeologists and\nanthropologists date their arrival much later, in the late seventeenth century. Madeline Island\nwas renamed from the original Ojibwe name Mo-ning-wun-a-kawn-ing, “the place of the goldbreasted\nwoodpecker,” to honor the daughter of the chief of the Crane Clan and wife of French\nfur trader Michel Cadotte. The Ojibwe may well have chosen the beautiful wooded island for a\nsettlement because of the protection of Lake Superior waters and their bountiful ﬁsh.\n<br><br>\nWith the coming of the French in the seventeenth century, the Ojibwe of Madeline Island\nattracted Jesuit missionaries and fur traders who used La Pointe as their base of activity. The village\ndeveloped as the principal Ojibwe spiritual and economic center. Missionary activity and\npopulation growth were probably the main causes for the departure of some Ojibwe for the mainland,\nwhere they spread well to the west, hunting and trading in competition with others, notably\nthe Sioux. During the fur trade era of French, British, and American control, La Pointe remained\na center for the trade, and in its years of sharp decline the American Fur Company renewed\noperations at La Pointe by making it the main base for a commercial ﬁshing industry on Lake\nSuperior in the late 1830s. As historian Grace Lee Nute has noted, there the company built a\nsettlement to serve the fur trade and ﬁshing, but the company did not long remain in pursuit of\nthe ﬁsheries along the adjacent coast and among the Apostle Islands. Hard times and marketing\nproblems made the ﬁsheries a short-lived enterprise. The La Pointe band of Ojibwe remained.\n<br><br>\nThose bands who had spread out from La Pointe across what is now northern Wisconsin\nand parts of Minnesota had weakened in numbers and health, and the Ojibwe had been maneuvered\ninto ceding their vast tribal territories—but not the rights to hunt, ﬁsh, and gather on these\nlands—by treaties with the U.S. government in 1837 and 1842. With the copper rush of the 1840s,\npressure was upon them to remove completely to selected federal lands in Minnesota far from\nwhite settlement. The efforts of the Ojibwe and their non-Native allies and especially the skillful\nleadership of the elderly Chief Buffalo forestalled the move. Government officials and a large\ncontingent of Ojibwe, reportedly 2,000, gathered at La Pointe to negotiate and to agree on the\nterms of the Treaty of La Pointe signed September 30, 1854.\n<br><br>\nIt created the Bad River, Lac du Flambeau, Red Cliff, and Lac Court Oreilles Reservations\nin Wisconsin; the l’Anse and Ontonagon in Michigan; and the Fond du Lac and Grand Portage\nin Minnesota. Two hundred acres on the northeast point of Madeline Island became part of the\nBad River Reservation, a treaty provision designed to allow the Ojibwe to ﬁsh in a favorite location.\nSome Ojibwe, those employed at La Pointe, were allowed to remain, but the balance moved\nto the Red Cliff and Bad River Reservations. La Pointe became the designated place for annuity\npayments. This brief statement about the Ojibwe heritage at La Pointe is what makes Madeline\nIsland’s heritage unique among the Apostle Islands. The departure of the Ojibwe from La Pointe\ngreatly diminished the island population.\n<br><br>\nFrom the mid-nineteenth century on, the island in some respects paralleled the other islands\nwith ﬁshing, logging, and some farming. A modest tourist and resort component developed at\nthe end of the nineteenth century and continued to exist in the twentieth. Summer homes for\nthe wealthy and those with more modest incomes grew in importance, but the village had long\nsince lost the county seat to Ashland and never developed as an important Chequamegon Bay\nport as village fathers hoped. Those who despaired to see the world pass them by in the 1870s\nwould be amazed to know that currently Madeline Island has a year-round population of 180 that\nexpands to 2,500 in the summer. Largely because of the extent of development on Madeline\nIsland, it was not included in the National Lakeshore.\n<br><br>\nBogue, <i>Around the Shores of Lake Superior<\/i>, 341-342.<br>\nCopyright &copy; 2007<br>\nThe Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System<br>\nAll rights reserved.", "timestamp": null, "begin": null, "end": null, "altitudeMode": null, "tessellate": -1, "extrude": 0, "visibility": -1, "drawOrder": null, "icon": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -90.680169917585786, 46.824627949239513, 0.0 ] } },

Herbster is rich in lake, stream, river,\nbird, and animal resources, and basing its appeal on these currently fosters tourism and recreation.\n<br><br>\nBogue, <i>Around the Shores of Lake Superior<\/i>, 348-349.<br>\nCopyright &copy; 2007<br>\nThe Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System<br>\nAll rights reserved.", "timestamp": null, "begin": null, "end": null, "altitudeMode": null, "tessellate": -1, "extrude": 0, "visibility": -1, "drawOrder": null, "icon": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -91.262222246183612, 46.832544581300908, 0.0 ] } },

The river ﬁgures prominently in seventeenth-century colonial history as a route of French explorers, fur traders, voyageurs, and missionaries into northwestern Wisconsin and as a connector with the Mississippi River. For centuries before their coming, native people used it in pursuit of trade, hunting, warfare, and food gathering. In the late nineteenth century lumbermen “improved” the river and used it for log delivery to Lake\nSuperior, where ships and rafts carried the timber harvest away to mill and market. In the last 19 miles of its run to Lake Superior the Bois Brule drops 328 feet or 17 feet per mile as its\nsparkling waters cascade through steep bluffs and beautiful woods along the way.\n<br><br>\nThe state forest, covering 40,882 acres in 2005, has a nearly century-long history beginning\nwith a gift of 4,300 acres from lumber baron Frederick Weyerhaeuser in 1907 to the state of Wisconsin\nfor “forestry purposes.”  Thereafter additions increased its size, especially in the 1930s when\nvast acreages of tax delinquent cutover lands came to state, county, and federal control for the\npurpose of reforestation and for controlled commercial and recreational use. The forest gradually\nassumed its present size, spreading over the entire length of the river. Millions of trees have\nbeen planted as part of the management plan to protect the watershed, its wetlands, ﬁsh, and\nabundant wildlife.\n<br><br>\nDesigned to help visitors enjoy the natural environment, the state forest includes a nature center,\nforty campsites, picnicking areas, two self-guided nature trails, and snowmobile, cross-country\nski, and mountain bike trails. Licensed hunting and ﬁshing are permitted. For information inquire\nat Forest Headquarters reached by the following the directions above.<br>Open year-round.

It is a “rare American\nexample of a northern European style windmill,” one of a very few grist mills in the Midwest\nand the only one in Wisconsin known to be of Finnish origin, the National Register nomination\nnotes. Jacob Davidson (Jaako Tapola), an immigrant from Finland, where he had been a\nmillwright, settled at this Amnicon River location in 1887 to develop an 80-acre farm. Because\nmills in Superior were not readily accessible to the settlers in the area, he began constructing the\nmill in 1905 using a Finnish octagonal design and proportioning the structure, it is said, like a\ncoffeepot to get the correct proportions. The materials for the most part and the labor were local.\nAfter four years of hard work, the mill went into operation and continued until 1926, when it\ncould no longer compete with Superior mills, which were accessible by then. Strong winds off\nLake Superior 2.5 miles away supplied the power so well that no more than two-thirds of the sheet\nmetal sails were ever installed on the eight arms. In 1956 the family repaired the ravages of time,\nand the mill stands in excellent condition, well worth viewing today. It is located so close to State\nHighway 13 that one can easily drive past it. If you do, turn around. It deserves a thoughtful visit.\n<br><br>\nBogue, <i>Around the Shores of Lake Superior<\/i>, 351.<br>\nCopyright &copy; 2007<br>\nThe Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System<br>\nAll rights reserved.", "timestamp": null, "begin": null, "end": null, "altitudeMode": null, "tessellate": -1, "extrude": 0, "visibility": -1, "drawOrder": null, "icon": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -91.856904703803437, 46.692209091272467, 0.0 ] } },

The Amnicon River, whose name means “where ﬁsh\nspawn” in Ojibwe, makes a 180-foot drop in less than 2 miles as it rushes lakeward, and a total\ndescent of 640 feet from headwaters to lakeside.\n<br><br>\nThe park area has a rich history of human use. First, Native People hunted and ﬁshed here.\nNext came fur traders and trappers. Copper prospectors followed, and some evidence of their\npresence remains. Thereafter the brownstone and timber resources attracted entrepreneurs. The\nAmnicon served as an avenue for logs driven downriver to Lake Superior. Finally the falls area\nevolved into a park in the years 1932-61, growing from 60 acres to its present size, 825 acres, and\nowned successively by the town, the county, and ﬁnally the state of Wisconsin.\n<br><br>\nAt the park entrance station visitors will ﬁnd information about park facilities and natural\nfeatures. The park includes a campground with thirty-six reserved campsites, a number of picnic\nlocations, well-developed trails, a covered bridge for viewing the upper and lower falls, and\nthe extended Thimbleberry Nature Trail. The park staff offers seasonal naturalist programs. The\nentrance station is the place to check in for reserved campsites. Open year-round.
