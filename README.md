# wisconsin-coastal-guide

To Do
- [ ] Compress panorama photos (need to get photoshop first)
- [ ] Handle overlapping points
- [ ] Add links to `data/serve/wcg-lighthouses.json` (poorly formatted html strings will make this difficult to do programmatically)
- [ ] Add popups for paths
- [ ] Handle spacing at bottom of page on mobile safari
- [ ] Ensure browser compatibility
- [ ] Work on mobile version
- [ ] Handle disconnected state
- [ ] Add search feature (?)
- [ ] Edit base map to show less detail (no small town names, no minor highhway shields, etc.) (this has been changed in mapbox studio but changes are not yet reflecfted in-app)
